# custom-vso-agent-tasks
Custom VSO Agent Tasks I have created for demos and personal use.

The SqlPackageTask requires a [Web API that simply returns the IP of the caller](http://www.donovanbrown.com/post/2015/05/15/i-need-my-external-ip-in-my-powershell). This is required to set the firewall rules in Azure. The WebOps project can be built using Visual Studio 2015 and hosted in a free Azure Web App. The directions on how to upload these tasks to your Visual Studio Online account are on [DonovanBrown.com](http://donovanbrown.com).
